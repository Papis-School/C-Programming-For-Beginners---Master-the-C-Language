# Fundamental of a program

- Computers are dumb machines as they only do what they are told to do
- The basic operation of a computer will form what its known as instruction set
- Instruction set is the instructions on the cpu - a computer program sends the instructions to the instruction set thats necessary to solve a problem
- The approach for solving this problem is known as **algorithm**
- The CPU does most of the computing work, where instructions are executed.
- RAM(Memory) stores data of a program while its running - Temporary storage
- ROM(Hard drive) - Stores files that contain source code of a program. On and off computer, the files are still stored
- Operating system makes it easier to use a computer, lower level its all instructions on instruction set, OS constrol all the operation of the computer, input output hardware, execution of applications...e.g windows, linux, android
- Lifecycle of cpu called the detch/execute cycle. - fetch instruction from memory using register and execute its (loop), a gigahertz cpu can do a billion times loop a sec
- The CPU is a loop
- High level programming language makes it easier to write programs - Opposite of low level such as assembly
- Compiler translate high level lang source code into detailed machine language instruction the computer requires
- Compiler checks programs for valid syntaxes, find errors and report back to you and does not produce an executable until you fix this error
